**Building up my foundation at the CodeCrafters International**

Started my professional journey on the 6th May, 2007 at 8 AM, just after finishing my last term final exam at BUET on the previous day 5th May, 2007. Still I had my thesis submission pending, my result publication pending, and I skipped the long-cherished morning sleepover after the final exam. I needed a job, and I did not want to delay even an hour.

**Life changing agression at SSD-TECH**

While CodeCrafters built and shaped my foundation as a meticulous software engineer, it is SSD-TECH that injected passion, ambition, commitment, agression in my professional DNA.

**Play (hard) as you like and Flying at KONA Software Lab Ltd.**

At KONASL, I could combine the both worlds of CodeCrafters and SSD-Tech into me. I could play hard in delivery, I could go deep in R&D, I could fly high with business. It provided me an excellent platform to utilize my past learning and push myself to the journey of a complete leadership.
